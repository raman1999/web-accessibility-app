## Web Accessibility Starter Pack

### W.A.S.P

### What is Web Accessibility Starter Pack (WASP)?

Web Accessibility Starter Pack is a project made by us as part of HackNeog’22.
We found that most Junior developers are not aware of web-accessibility and the repercussions of not understanding it properly.

That’s why we decided to do something about it!

## Tools We Offer

### Holistic view of devices

We created a tool that lets you see how your website looks on all screen sizes on a single page.
It also allows for landscape and portrait modes in cumulation of screenshot feature.

### Lighthouse Metrics

We run lighthouse checks on every webpage and generate metrics into quantifiable and user-understandable data. It also ranks different websites that you have run the checks on based on their score.

### Color Contrast

This tools warns you if you use colors which don’t fall under WCAG2 standards.
It also shows you how people with all three kinds of color blindness interpret colors.

### Typography Pairing

We generate random font-pairings that allows users to select from font’s that are easy on the eye.

### Leaderboard

We also created a leaderboard that ranks the websites based on the web metrics test that you run.

This gives you insight into where your website stands in comparison to others.

We would love if it if you guys run the tests and see if you can make it to the TOP!
